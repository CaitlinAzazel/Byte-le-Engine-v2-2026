For a good example of the new visualizer organization, highly recommend to look at the 2025 game:
https://github.com/acm-ndsu/Byte-le-2025/tree/main/visualizer

This folder is dedicated to visualizing the game created in the game folder through the use
of the json log files created when running the game. Visualization happens after the game is
completed.

This folder structure is as follows:
visualizer
     \___ bytesprites: folder for python files for associating spritesheets to pygame objects to render. See its help file.
     \___ fonts: folder for storing any fonts that need to be downloaded. See its help file.
     \___ images: folder for storing png files to be visualized.
             \___ spritesheets: folder for storing spritesheets, or png files used for dynamic textures (animations). See its help file.
             \___ staticsprites: folder for storing staticsprites, or png files used for static textures. See its help file.
     \___ sprites: folder for python files for associating a staticsprites to pygame objects to render. See its help file.
     \___ templates: folder for putting sprites and bytesprites needed to render around the actual game. Used in adapter.py.
     \___ utils: utility methods used throughout the above files. Does not need much adjustment.
\___ adapter: file that brings all templates together.
\___ config: visualizer config file, includes variables that can be used throughout the templates.
\___ main: main runner for looping the visualizer. Should never be touched unless you understand what you are doing.
